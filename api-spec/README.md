# API Specification - PollPal

This repository contains the initial API schema for PollPal, defined in the `openapi.yaml` file.

## Viewing the API Spec

1. Go to [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).
2. Click on **File** > **Import File** (or simply drag and drop the `openapi.yaml` file into the editor).
3. Explore the interactive documentation generated from the YAML file.

Also contains an API-overview document, if you prefer that better than viewing it on swagger.

## Note
- This is the initial API schema based on the current front-end designs, and swagger here is used for visualization purposes only.
- The whole team will need to meet multiple more times to refine the endpointsâ€”adding, modifying, or removing parts of the API as needed.
